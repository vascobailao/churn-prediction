# Churn Prediction

As a social network platform, one of our major concerns is user churn. The ability to identify potential user churn and proactively respond to retain those users is a valuable asset.

- Design a solution to identify users at risk of churning. This solution should include your approach to data analysis, choice of model(s), feature selection, and strategies for user retention.

- Implement a proof of concept of your solution design. This includes data preprocessing, a basic prediction model for user churn, and evaluation of the model's performance.
